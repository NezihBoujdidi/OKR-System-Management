# My Internship Project

This project was developed as part of my end-of-studies internship.

It was originally worked on and versioned in Azure DevOps,  
which explains the relatively few commits in this GitHub repository.

The project contains two main parts:

- `OKR-frontend/` — frontend application code  
- `OKR-backend/` — backend application code
