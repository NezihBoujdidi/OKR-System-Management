## Overview

The OKR module allows users to create, view, edit, and manage OKR sessions. An OKR session represents a time-boxed period (e.g., quarterly) during which teams track their objectives and key results. The module includes a main view showing all sessions, a timeline view, and forms for creating and editing sessions.

## Components

### OKRsComponent

The main component for the OKR module that displays the list of OKR sessions and manages the overall state.

**Key Features:**
- Displays OKR sessions in a grid with pagination
- Provides search and filtering capabilities
- Includes a timeline visualization of sessions
- Manages drawer components for creating/editing sessions
- Handles CRUD operations for sessions

**Technical Details:**
- Located at: `src/app/features/okrs/components/okrs.component.ts`
- Uses subscription management to prevent memory leaks
- Implements custom scrollbar using native DOM manipulation
- Uses NgZone for performance optimization on scroll events

**Public Methods:**
- `createNewSession()`: Opens the drawer to create a new session
- `onSessionEdit(session)`: Opens the edit drawer for a session
- `onSearch(query)`: Filters sessions based on search query
- `onSessionDeleted(sessionId)`: Handles session deletion

### NewSessionFormComponent

A reusable form component for creating and editing OKR sessions.

**Key Features:**
- Supports both creation and editing modes
- Validates form inputs including date range validation
- Provides visual feedback for form validation state
- Includes color selection for session visualization

**Technical Details:**
- Located at: `src/app/features/okrs/components/new-session-form/new-session-form.component.ts`
- Uses Angular Reactive Forms for form handling
- Implements proper input/output binding for parent-child communication
- Uses OnChanges lifecycle hook to respond to input changes

**Public Methods:**
- `resetForm()`: Resets the form to its initial state
- `resetFormState()`: Resets only the form submission state
- `onSubmit()`: Validates and submits the form data
- `selectColor(color)`: Sets the selected color for the session

### SessionCardComponent

A component that displays a single OKR session as a card.

**Technical Details:**
- Displays session information in a visually appealing card format
- Provides action menu for edit/delete operations
- Uses session color for visual indication
- Handles click events to navigate to session details

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

The application uses a combination of component state and service state to manage OKR data:

1. **OKRSessionService**: Central service for CRUD operations and maintaining the current state of sessions
2. **Component State**: Local state in `OKRsComponent` for UI-specific state like filtering, pagination, etc.
3. **Subscription Management**: All components implement OnDestroy to unsubscribe and prevent memory leaks

### Form Handling

The `NewSessionFormComponent` implements several best practices for Angular forms:

1. **Reactive Forms**: Uses FormBuilder and FormGroup for type-safe form handling
2. **Custom Validators**: Implements date range validation to ensure end date is after start date
3. **Error Handling**: Provides clear visual feedback on validation errors
4. **Form Reset Strategy**: Properly resets form state between submissions

### UI Interactions

The module implements several UI patterns for a smooth user experience:

1. **Drawer Pattern**: Uses slide-in drawers for forms to maintain context
2. **Click Outside Detection**: Closes drawers when clicking outside the content area
3. **Loading States**: Provides visual feedback during async operations
4. **Error Handling**: Shows appropriate error messages on failed operations

## Best Practices

The OKR module follows these Angular best practices:

1. **Subscription Management**: Uses the subscription pattern with proper cleanup
2. **Component Communication**: Uses Input/Output decorators for parent-child communication
3. **Defensive Programming**: Checks for null/undefined values before accessing properties
4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Uses NgZone to run non-Angular code outside change detection
   - Implements trackBy functions for ngFor loops
   - Lazy loads components as needed

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Proper ARIA attributes for interactive elements
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader friendly error messages

6. **Code Organization**:
   - Follows the Angular style guide for file naming and structure
   - Separates concerns between components, services, and models
   - Uses interfaces for type safety

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Save Changes" Button Stuck in Loading State

**Problem**: When clicking edit on a session and then clicking save, then editing another session, the save button would remain in a loading state.

**Solution**: 
1. Added proper state reset when opening a new edit drawer
2. Implemented the `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook to detect changes to input properties
3. Used setTimeout to ensure the form component is properly reset
4. Added session ID tracking to prevent race conditions with multiple edit operations

### Issue: Drawer Not Closing on Outside Click

**Problem**: When the drawer for creating or editing a session was open, clicking outside did not close it.

**Solution**:
1. Added a click event handler to the overlay background
2. Implemented event target checking to determine if the click occurred on the overlay itself
3. Call the appropriate close method when a valid outside click is detected
